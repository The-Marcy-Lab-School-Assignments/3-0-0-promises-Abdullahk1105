# Question

With `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...})`, which of the following makes the promise produce a value?

a. calling `resolve()` or `reject()`

b. calling _and_ returning them

# Answer

Calling `resolve()` or `reject()` would produce a value because in the from scratch everytime we call a return it is on the promise itself not the seperate `resolve()` or `reject()`. When we do `resolve()` in our promise it changes the promise value from pending to fulfilled. When we do `reject()` in our promise it changes pending to rejected, hence creating a new value without anything being returned.
