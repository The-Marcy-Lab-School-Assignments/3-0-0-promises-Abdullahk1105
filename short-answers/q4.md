# Question

with `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...})`, what do the arguments that you pass into `resolve/reject` do?

# Answer
The argument you pass to `resolve` specifies the value that the `Promise` will be resolved with. The argument you pass into `reject` specifies the reason for the rejection, which is an error message.

# Teacher Feedback
This is mostly right. The one thing that would made it perfect is mentioning that the values would be promise objects, and/or error objects.
