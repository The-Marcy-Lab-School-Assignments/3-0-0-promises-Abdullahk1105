# Question

with `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...})`, what do the arguments that you pass into `resolve/reject` do?

The argument you pass to `resolve` specifies the value that the `Promise` will be resolved with. The argument you pass into `reject` specifies the reason for the rejection, which is an error message.
