# Question

Consider the following code:

```js
Promise.resolve("Inside promise").then(console.log);
console.log("Outside promise");
```

Which prints first: `Inside promise` or `Outside promise`. More importantly, can you explain why?

# Answer

The `Outside promise` would print first because it is being console logged as a synchronous code, while the `Inside promise` is being run as asynchronous code because it is being console logged inside of a promise which is being resolved.
